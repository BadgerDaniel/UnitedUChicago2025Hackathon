# Flight SQL Integration Summary

## What We've Accomplished

### 1. Created SQL MCP Server
- **Location**: `/mcp_servers/flight_sql_server/`
- **File**: `flight_sql_server_stdio.py`
- **Purpose**: Provides historical flight pricing and weather analysis via DuckDB

### 2. Available SQL Tools
The FlightAgent now has access to 4 new SQL-powered tools:

1. **analyze-flight-sql** - Natural language queries on historical data
2. **get-route-prices** - Get historical prices for specific routes  
3. **analyze-price-trends** - Analyze pricing trends over time
4. **check-weather-impact** - Check weather conditions and price impacts

### 3. Database Contents
The DuckDB database contains:
- **7 cities**: Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, Denver, Newark, San Francisco, Washington DC
- **7 airports**: LAX, ORD, IAH, DEN, EWR, SFO, IAD
- **42 routes**: All combinations between the 7 cities
- **126 flight records**: Historical pricing data with quartiles
- **Weather data**: Weather conditions and alerts for each city

### 4. Integration Status
✅ SQL MCP server created and tested
✅ Database connection verified
✅ MCP server starts successfully
✅ Tools are exposed via MCP protocol
✅ FlightAgent loads all 14 tools (7 Amadeus + 3 Duffel + 4 SQL)
✅ Agent can execute SQL queries through natural language

### 5. Sample Queries That Work
- "What cities are available in your historical database?"
- "Show me all available routes in the database"
- "What are the price ranges for flights from Los Angeles to Chicago?"

### 6. Known Issues
- The SQL query generation sometimes has syntax errors with city names
- This is a LangChain/LLM issue that can be improved with better prompts

### 7. How to Test
```bash
# Test the SQL server directly
cd /Users/u404027/Desktop/multiagentmcp/mcp_servers/flight_sql_server
/Users/u404027/.local/bin/uv run python test_mcp_server.py

# Test the FlightAgent with SQL
cd /Users/u404027/Desktop/multiagentmcp
python test_flight_agent.py

# Start the full system
python start_ui.py
```

### 8. Next Steps
The system is ready for testing in the UI. The FlightAgent can now:
- Search real-time flights (Amadeus/Duffel)
- Analyze historical pricing trends (SQL/DuckDB)
- Correlate weather events with price changes
- Compare current vs historical prices
